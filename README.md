# Description
I made a Google Chrome extension that will convert the default Facebook Messenger (www.messenger.com) from its native bright white theme, to a muted black and grey theme which will be easier on the users eye.

# Technology
The extension uses Google's Content Script to detect www.messenger.com. Once this is detected, it overwrites (by injection) the native messenger CSS.
